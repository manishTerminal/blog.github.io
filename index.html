            <h2>PharmEasy</h2>

            <p>
              Founded by Dharmil Sheth, Dhaval Shah, and Mikhil Innani in the
              year 2015, PharmEasy is a Mumbai-based startup focusing on the
              health care, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical industries. It is an
              online medical store that has everything one could imagine in an
              actual medical or pharmacy store â€” OTC products, medical
              instruments, and even diagnostic tests! PharmEasy helps patients
              connect with local diagnostic centres, assists with medicine
              delivery, and takes care of other medical needs. PharmEasy has had
              tremendous growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, gaining popularity
              and even becoming an essential service today. After its merger
              with Medlife, the startup has raised over $350 million. Through
              the merger, PharmEasy has been able to get an edge over the
              competition from other big e-pharmacy brands like Flipkart and
              Amazon Pharmacy. The startup is planning to expand by reaching out
              to other pharmacies and covering more geographical areas.
